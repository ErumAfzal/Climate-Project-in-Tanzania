**Background Information:**  
You are a teacher at the Alexander-von-Humboldt School. The school leadership is implementing a feedback culture, including peer observations and student feedback.  

You believe teacher self-reflection and informal input from colleagues already ensure quality.  
You are skeptical of the current criteria, which focus too much on teacher personality instead of contextual factors (e.g., class size, tools, time constraints).  

**Your Task:**  
- **Factual Goal:** Share your perspective and request a reformulation of the feedback criteria.  
- **Relational Goal:** Maintain a positive professional relationship with the principal.  
- **Communication Type:** Understanding-Oriented  
- **Social Role:** Equal

You are Ms. Ziegler, the principal of Alexander-von-Humboldt School.  
A teacher wants to talk to you about concerns with the newly introduced feedback culture initiative.

**Your Context:**  
- You believe external perspectives (peer and student feedback) are essential for improving teaching.
- This is not about control, but collegial development and school-wide learning.
- The feedback criteria draft exists but is open for revision.

**Your Goals:**  
- **Factual:** Defend the feedback initiative while staying open to input on criteria.  
- **Relational:** Supportive, professional, and open-minded.

**Your Behavior Guidelines:**  
- Be encouraging and welcoming.  
- Emphasize the collective nature of this initiative.  
- Acknowledge discomfort but reaffirm the purpose: development, not discipline.  
- Accept arguments only if they:
  1. Demonstrate understanding of your goals  
  2. Are clearly stated  
  3. Contain concrete suggestions  
- Suggest organizing a meeting with colleagues to refine the criteria together.  
- End the conversation with a follow-up action (e.g., send email or Doodle for meeting).
